# SDL2 & C++11 test

This is simply me playing around with the new features of C++11 in the context
of a game in SDL1.3 (rechristened SDL2 - think Java 1.5).

#To-do:
### Lambdas!
Lambdas are cool. Closures moreso.
### Figure out a good reason to use transform over for_each. 
Self-explanatory.

#Requirements
+ GCC 4.7; not every compiler supports C++11 equally.
+ Eclipse 3.7 because I'm too lazy to do a makefile and Xcode 3 doesn't do anything better than GCC 4.2.
+ SDL2 as libSDL2.dylib/.so/.a/.dll or what-have-you. I'm using a build from the end February 2012.
